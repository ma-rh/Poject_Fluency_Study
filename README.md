# Project_Fluency_Study
An experiment to test the fluency effect by manipulation of visual complexity of web pages.

Fluency is the perceived Easiness with which information are being processed. This affects our judgement to aesthetic, familiarity and trust.

In our study we explore the judgement of 120 participants to 10 different websites. These websites were manipulatied in typographie, symmetrie, contrast and in combination.
The procedure was coded using Inquisit 5. The results showed that the manipulations of typography, symmetry and contrast increase the visual complexity. However, due to the change of visual complexity no influence of the fluency effect on the judgment of the subjects could be determined.
